# Making a Chess GUI (Engine?)

For the longest time @rhyn0 has enjoyed playing Chess. While never being great at it, the game is always interesting and anyone is able to improve at it every day.
Inspired by this experience, @rhyn0 decided to make a chess game GUI. This project has stalled a lot but with Rust becoming popular and lots of good packages becoming available, it seemed like a good time to work on it again.

This is a restart using Rust. Rust is amazing for its massive typing system and helpful compiler.

## Dependencies

This project will be using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as the GUI framework.

## Desirable Features

- [ ] have an secondary board layout (circle seems fun)
- [ ] button to output FEN at any point in the game
